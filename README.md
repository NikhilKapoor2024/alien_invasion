# Project: Alien Invasion

This is my first big project with **Python**.

A game where the player controls a rocket ship that is being attacked by aliens. The goal is
to shoot as many alien ships down as possible before any of them reach the player ship's
location and deal damage. If enough damage is taken by the player, they are eliminated
from the game.

This project demonstrates use of the **Pygame** Python module, management skills for large
projects that span multiple files, and having fun with learning **Python**.
